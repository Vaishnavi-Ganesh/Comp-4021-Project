For upper division courses, they need instructor approval to receive access to the course. \n Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment: If there are a large number of open seats, students will be allowed to enroll in courses for which they meet prerequisites. If there are very few seats available, advisors will wait until 1-2 weeks before the start of the semester before giving permission for exchange students to enroll. \n Engineering of Matter, Transport, and Energy: After all registration has opened, students will be given overrides into courses that still have a lot of seats open. If there are 10 or less seats available, advisors will wait until 1-2 weeks before the start of the semester before giving permission for exchange students to enroll. \n Students cannot take Journalism (JMC) courses at ASU. They can only take Mass Communication (MCO) courses, which are very limited in offerings.",
